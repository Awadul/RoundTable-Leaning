That's the core problem with most corporate learning programs – they pull employees away from their actual jobs to learn skills they'll need to apply later, somewhere else, under different conditions. This disconnect costs organizations millions in lost productivity and creates the frustrating gap between knowing and doing.\n\nPhygital training eliminates this problem entirely. By merging physical work environments with digital learning technologies, it delivers instruction exactly where and when employees need it most – during actual work tasks. This isn't just another training buzzword; it's a fundamental shift that's delivering measurable results for forward-thinking organizations.",

Instead of taking workers away from their jobs to sit in classrooms or complete online modules, phygital training brings instruction directly to the workplace using augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality tools.\n\nThe key difference is context. Traditional training asks employees to imagine how they'll apply new knowledge later. Phygital training eliminates imagination from the equation – workers learn by doing, with digital guidance layered onto their actual tasks and equipment. This direct connection between learning and application accelerates skill development while maintaining productivity.\n\nWhen a technician receives step-by-step AR instructions overlaid on the actual machine they're repairing, that's phygital. When warehouse operators practice with VR simulations of their exact facility layout before receiving real-time guidance through AR, that's phygital. The technology serves the work, not the other way around."

          "content": "The numbers don't lie. Contextual learning can improve skill retention by up to 90% compared to traditional classroom instruction. This dramatic improvement happens because the brain forms stronger neural pathways when information is learned and applied simultaneously in the same environment.\n\nThis enhanced retention translates directly into business value. Faster skill transfer means employees reach full productivity sooner, reducing the time investment required for competency development. Training costs drop significantly when you eliminate instructor travel, dedicated training facilities, and time away from productive work.\n\nEmployee engagement increases when training feels immediately relevant and useful. Workers appreciate learning approaches that respect their time and provide practical value, leading to higher participation rates and better outcomes. This engagement creates a positive feedback loop that strengthens the entire learning culture.\n\nThe scalability advantage is equally important. Phygital solutions provide consistent, high-quality training across multiple locations without proportional increases in training staff or resources. Organizations can maintain training standards while expanding operations or entering new markets."

To define microlearning more clearly: it is usually in a portable or easy-access format (handout, mobile doc, Articulate slides, common app).\n\n👉 Corporate microlearning is the granola-bar of training and development: a short and sweet but substantive snack; conveniently packaged, easy to distribute and quickly consumable.\n\nUnforgettable Snacks? The psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus developed the \"forgetting curve,\" which was a complex series of experiments and equations about memory. While it's a complicated stat, one figure from the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve is that the information starts fading within 20 minutes; even if someone memorizes the content word-for-word. So even if an employee learns a process by heart at the end of an evening skills training, some of it's already gone before they get home!\n\nBy giving a learner less to learn, microlearning courses encourage better memory retention. That's one big way that the compact, on-demand, bullseye-specific practice of microlearning modules works. But there are many other effective elements to it. In this article we'll look at these short bursts of focused practice, microlearning videos, and various training insights that keep learners engaged.",

Example: the \"wrist coach\"/playbook a quarterback wears to know the play action. 🏈\n\nShort videos: a quick video can be a standalone job aid for simple viewing, or it can instruct the learner in an interactive task. Example: a three-minute video showing an onboarder at a financial services firm how to set up and log in to their company email. Short videos are among the most effective microlearning examples.\n\nFAQ sites: FAQ sites are the ultimate on-demand examples of microlearning. An example could be a webpage on the company intranet; what were the \"A.B.C.'s of customer service again\"? That sort of thing.\n\nShort eLearning courses: Brief eLearning courses can be interactive and are an effective way to deliver information-rich content. Example: an Articulate module for compliance training on signing out the keys to a forklift at a warehouse. It might have four frames and a fill-in-the-blank last section."

Think of the classic magazine design rather than a book. A book has progressing chapters but in a magazine, there are quality standalone articles still within a broader idea or topic. You don't have to read all of them to understand just one.\n\nNot suited for complex systems: Does the training gap involve multi-step equipment operations? Does it involve regulatory frameworks or compliance? There's simply too much relevant information to put into microlearning. Even if it was broken into numerous tiny modules, microlearning modules—by design—have little or no overlap. In such cases, in depth training is required.\n\nNot suited for bedrock skills: Think of the instruction manuals that come with a ceiling fan. They won't teach someone how to be an electrician. Likewise, microlearning examples are for tasks or skills within an established body of knowledge or for something universally intuitive. Complex topics that require in depth training are not suitable for this format.\n\nRequired training or remedial skills: On-demand and at your own schedule is great. Still, sometimes, training in the workplace needs to happen regardless of buy-in. It's essential to consider how necessary the training is and how motivated your particular learners will be to do it."

Yet, speed matters too. Warehousing, freight, logistics, retail, and goods processing are volume enterprises. Not to mention, it's essential to get the orders right. Safe operations, speed, and accuracy–good employee training in both hard and soft skills is relevant for all of these.\n\nIn any training program, it's important to cross your t's and dot your lowercase j's as you prepare new hires for the reality of their roles. Two criteria we've already mentioned are at the top of the list for warehouse training. On that list, these criteria are typed in size 72 font, underlined and bold: reduce errors and boost productivity. Volume and safe operations are vital. In a warehouse environment, volume is the foundation, but safe operations is the bedrock. And there are actually some soft skills, including how to help everyone communicate clear expectations."

If you want an idea about how complex it gets, look at a chart diagramming the ideas behind this keystone of safety warehouse operations, as identified by the 5th Logistics International Conference. Indeed, it's a tad complex.\n\nBut if we take away nothing else from the conference diagram, we can safely say pairing smooth operations with heavy machinery and logistics coordination is a complicated process. All pieces of inventory management are surprisingly complex, and Roundtable Learning found this out when we created an \"decanting\" program for a Fortune 10 retail client with high-volume location.

But how well do they work?\n\nOn-the-job training is a classic modality. It's hard to beat, but it consumes warehouse management hours. Plus, new employees' understanding of the warehouse skills, equipment, and many other things is incomplete. And they're doing all this at a volume speed. That default level of speed and the complexity of certain tasks means–despite their best efforts–they're going to make mistakes.\n\nThe result is that training errors disrupt the flow of inventory, which can interrupt operations. VR warehouse training prepares the workforce to confidently step into roles on location. Warehouse VR skills lessons can help your workplace operate safely and efficiently, promoting a higher overall company health score regardless of location.

VR warehouse training is true visual hack.\n\nThis neuro-visual physiology is why automotive designers put certain important buttons on the heads-up display in vehicles. When the VR headset is strapped on, the learner's entire central focus is on the task at hand. The tight turns, blind corners, and random dim spots–where a light bulb is burnt out, and maintenance needs a scissor lift to change it because it's 60 feet up–are real hazards and hassles of the highly kinetic warehousing field. Keeping your eye on the ball matters.\n\nWarehouse VR locks in the visual attention of trainees, but it doesn't stop there. We want learners to absorb as much information as possible in any training program. The multi-sensory elements of sound and even tactile add-ons instill a deeper impression for when they finish training and get assigned to their work location.

          "content": "Augmented Reality (AR) enhances the real world by overlaying digital content like text, images, or 3D objects, onto a user's physical environment through a smartphone, tablet, or AR-enabled headset.\n\nWith AR, learners can interact with virtual instructions layered on real-world equipment, preview digital objects within the physical world, or visualize complex systems in motion. A common example is IKEA's app, which allows users to place and view digital models of furniture in their home using their phone's camera to see if it fits in their space.\n\nAR content can include shapes, annotations, animations, or even full 3D models, helping users better understand real-world tasks through real-time guidance and visualization.\n\nDevices that support AR include smartphones, tablets, and AR headsets like Microsoft HoloLens, Magic Leap or Snapchat Spectacles. While some wearable tech (like Ray-Ban Stories or Echo Frames) includes cameras and voice assistants, they don't yet offer true AR functionality.\n\n⚙️⚙️⚙️AR vs VR. Let's Drill-Down and Get Technical:\n\nAR programs involve a constellation of digital entities seen through a portal. That portal could be a smartphone, a tablet or another device. Those entities can be shapes, letters (or characters, depending on the language), linear outlines, annotations or a number of digitally-produced visual elements. The digital entities can overlay, outline or enhance what the person sees. AR can also create or broadcast into place whole objects over a blank space.⚙️⚙️⚙️\n\nAR doesn't have distinct levels or types, but it has four capabilities. (Various experts in the field say it's three, others say five different types or capabilities). Some of the functions overlap (and overlapping is one type of AR, just to make things even more confusing), but these are the three primary ways it works: 1) marker-based, 1a) non-marker-based, 2) projection and 3) overlap.",

VR training is a more thoroughly immersive technology than AR, as it removes all distractions from the real world allowing learners to focus, react, and make decisions just as they would in a high-stakes situation, minus the actual danger. \n\nThere are numerous situations such as fire drills, disaster evacuation, active shooter or chemical spill events where VR is especially effective. Hazardous environments where an emergency response with split-second real time feedback is necessary are among the best situations for full-on, get-in-and-go VR.\n\nCritical Soft Skills Through VR Role-Play. Real-world scenarios meas people need to interact with others. For high-risk, interpersonal roles like law enforcement or triage nurses, success often comes down to communication, de-escalation, and decision-making under stress. \n\nVR makes it possible to safely rehearse these interactions through immersive role-play scenarios. Whether it's navigating a tense conversation or responding to an armed individual, learners can follow proven communication strategies in a realistic simulation. \n\nThe simulation can produce these real world scenarios as digital information so as to create an immersive experience. Step-by-step tactics and branching scenarios help reinforce the right behaviors, so employees are prepared to handle interpersonal challenges with confidence and care. In these cases, step-by-step, flowchart-style de-escalation tactics and strategic communication can actually be rehearsed. \n\nSimulated Driving in Virtual Reality.

Roundtable has worked with countless clients using both HMDs and virtual reality without a headset.\n\nOne of the very early VR headsets was about the size of a small microwave. These enormous, rudimentary head-mounted displays (HMDs) came about as job aids, specifically for aviation and related needs (look up Thomas Furness and HIT labs). Thankfully, today's VR headsets used in the workplace or for fun weigh under two pounds. It's a frequently asked question and the answer is very much yes, VR can happen without a headset."

Real life learning can happen with something as basic as some cardboard and some clear plastic.\n\nA cardboard headset is a more affordable, lightweight, and scalable option than a typical VR headset. A cardboard VR headset works for organizations that may not be ready to invest in full-scale hardware. These headsets come in at a low price-point (cardboard under $20; hard plastic, polymer or other roughly $50).\n\nThese are your definite option for bottom-rung simple tasks related to immediate workplace training needs that need to happen on a huge scale. For US companies, most employees can get the training right away since 91% of Americans have smartphones.",

Once placed inside the headset, learners interact with VR content.\n\nInteraction happens in a number of ways. Many newer smartphones, such as iPhones and AndroidsiPads, have some element of eye tracking. Also, the phone's internal gyroscopes are talking in real-time to other components. (Most handheld or worn digital devices operate using these gyroscopic sensors.) These sensors help adjust what the learner sees and hears. And some smartphones can even integrate handheld controllers.\n\n→ Plus, the company-branded cardboard headset is a classic onboarding gift along with other SWAG (Stuff We All Get) for new employees. https://tenor.com/s2Dy.gif"

The positive reception of VR in corporate training makes perfect sense. With a fresh standard for innovation, organizations aspire to benefit from the latest learning technologies.\n\nAs technology accelerates, digital possibilities become more ubiquitous and VR training cost goes down.\n\nThe transformative nature of VR–which does an end run around training travel expenses and many costly safety measures required for specific skill sets–is getting a lot of attention from Fortune 500s. And many companies are using it to jump ahead, including with revenue.\n\nThe cost and complexity of VR programs vary based on factors like development time and the level of customization. The question of cost ultimately depends on how far you want to extend the capabilities of VR. Each price point of VR offers specific deliverables.

There's also getting VR modules to look and act like real life as much as possible which supports immersive learning. As with each other element, the length, complexity, training time and interactivity will be the biggest cost factors.\n\nBut speaking the right 'language' is essential.\n\nVR Training Cost and Advanced Programming Languages. Developers must be proficient in programming languages to work with Unity. The level of user activity, number of interactions, types of interactions, and the virtual setting of a VR training project all impact how many hours will be required during the development period.\n\nLanguages in the gaming world, like technology, are not completely static either. This dynamism adds to the development time and cost. For example, Unity, a universal interactive digital content programming language, has weekly updates with patches and fixes! Finding and retaining the best programmers in demanding languages is another element involved when considering cost efficiency. However, price also comes up when considering the timeframe: just how advanced, interactive, and company-specific the content needs to be.\n\nHardware and More. Also, consider training content creation costs for haptics and audio. These very much add to the effect of real world scenarios. Multi-sensory engagement is a continuously growing field in the science of learning.\n\nAdding advanced hardware can have a major effect for immersive learning and are increasingly used in VR technology. And while hardware upgrades are determined in upfront costs, they can have long term benefits.\n\nFor example, BNSF Railway uses haptic feedback gloves to give their train mechanics the real sensation of holding a three-foot-long calibrating wrench on a schoolbus-sized diesel electric train engine.\n\nTesting, Testing 1,2,3.

It's also a great way to familiarize learners and to show that VR training delivers.\n\nThe opening drive could be a pilot program or VR project with fewer development demands. That low bar can be a way to test learning outcomes before a full-scale dive.\n\nIt's important to note that VR content doesn't have to be fully customized to be exceptional. At this price, a program may be limited on the number of modules (usually one; two if short) or the level of customization of 3D objects. Developers can integrate pre-built assets from their content library, especially when specific customization isn't necessary for learner success.\n\nFor example, it would be difficult to recreate an entire storefront from top to bottom for less than $100k. However, VR programs can recreate the standard interior of a warehouse, office, or retail store. It all depends on whether or not there's an absolute need to replicate every element of your brand and environment."

            "content": "If you're looking to make a splash, $100-$200k is the standard for custom VR. This price point allows developers to tailor 3D objects with much greater customization specific to your needs. Those customizations include logos, colors, replicas (at least one Fortune 25 company has their own required font) and other forms of distinct visuals that can be accomplished. What you'll get for this cost helps distinguish generic content from proprietary. For example, implementing a specific tool that is exclusively used by your employees may help to close skill gaps faster by immersing learners in a realistic preview of their role.\n\nWith this spend, developers can replicate the specific tools and processes your team uses on a daily basis. This could be learning how to use a specific scanner for inventory. It could be the different ways of handling a variety of products only your company carries, or operating equipment that was built specifically for your organization. As the overall complexity and number of modules are increased, so will the level of customization of 3D objects and environments."

The model suggests that 70% of the average person's knowledge is obtained by doing on-the-job experiences, 20% from social sources such as interactions with others, and 10% from formal training and events. Origins of the model date back to the 1980s when researchers McCall, Lombardo, and Morrison were interested in explaining the key developmental experiences of successful leaders.\n\nThe model describes the optimal sources of learning, suggesting that individuals obtain knowledge, skills, and abilities in their jobs mostly when doing hands-on experiences. They found that learners obtain knowledge best when doing hands-on activities because it enables them to discover and refine their job-related skills, make informed decisions, and tackle challenges at work. Another important factor of the model is that employees learn from their mistakes and receive immediate feedback on their performance.",

The model is considered to be of greatest value as a general guideline for organizations looking to maximize the effectiveness of their learning and development programs through other activities and inputs. By applying this model to your learning and development programs, you can ensure that your organization provides adequate learning and development opportunities catered to your employees' needs.\n\nPart of what makes the 70:20:10 Model so attractive is that it generally makes sense on the surface as it represents a common-sense structure of developmental experiences of employees. Learning professionals should apply this model to their workforce by creating a controlled environment where learners can make choices and face consequences — both good and bad. Proper performance support is key throughout the application of this model to ensure that learners feel supported and guided at work."

Unlike decades ago, the world is now heavily influenced by powerful web searches, social media, and cell phones.\n\nModern learning and development tools and tactics are certainly richer than what was available before, so it makes sense that today's training is heavily shaped by the influx of technology in the workplace. Some argue that while the model's ratios may not reflect current learning and development practices, the model is mostly still consistent with the developmental experiences of employees.\n\nThe onslaught of learning technologies in the past couple of decades has altered the training industry's views of the 70:20:10 Model. Some training professionals contend that the model doesn't reflect the market's fast-growing emphasis on informal learning and the constant evolution of technology. Whether you agree or disagree, the model continues to be used as a guideline on how to employ various developmental experiences."
